 # CROSS-PROBABILISTIC WEAK SUPERVISION LEARNING FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION LAND COVER ENHANCEMENT 
This research focused on a weak supervision strategy for deep learning aimed at enhancing high-resolution (sub-meter) land cover from historical pseudo (noise) labels. The study involved developing a deep learning architecture that could be supervised
using unified noise or imbalanced datasets as a reasonable training set during the knowledge acquisition phase. The main concern was how to overcome the barriers of spatial resolution mismatch between pairs of
machine learning to train sets derived from high-resolution images representing complex urban features and rural image features, regardless of photogrammetric and heterogeneity in landforms.
